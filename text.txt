                               For example, applying the sensitivity label ‘highly confidential’ to a document that contains social security numbers and credit card numbers helps you identify the sensitivity of the document without knowing the actual data in the document.

The user sees a generic error message that says they're unauthorized to access the app and they should ask their admin for help. The admin consent workflow (Preview) gives admins a secure way to grant access to applications that require admin approval. When a user tries to access an application but is unable to provide consent, they can send a request for admin approval. The request is sent via email to admins who have been designated as reviewers. A reviewer acts on the request, and the user is notified of the action.
